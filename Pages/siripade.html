        <p class="hotel-des">The mountain of Sri Pada is one of the rare places that people of four major religions in the world worship. The mountain is situated in the Rathnapura district with a height of 7,360 feet (2,243 meters).

            Although this is only the second-highest mountain, It rises majestically with a conical shape and offers an unobstructed view over land and sea. It is said that the mountain was the landmark of the ancient sea-faring Arabs, who came to Sri Lanka, to trade in gems, spices, ivory, etc., and they, having sighted the conical mountain miles offshore, prayed to God for having brought them safely to the island.
            <br>According to Sri Lanka’s great chronicle, Mahawamsa, Buddha visited Sri Lanka three times. The last time he traveled from Kelaniya to Sri Pada, and then to Digavaphi thus consisted in the Solosmasthana of Sri Lanka. It is said that Buddha left his footprint on the rock at the peak of the mountain at the invitation of the Deity Saman (Saman Deviyo).

            Deity Saman is recorded as having met the Buddha on his first visit to the island when he visited Mahiyangana to drive away the Tribe of Yakkas. Saman became a stream-entrant (sotapanna) after listening to the Buddha. Deity Saman then requested an object of worship, and Buddha gave him a handful of hairs with which he enshrined on a dagaba at Mahiyangana.
            
            
            The Theravada Buddhists of Sri Lanka later made Deity Saman the guardian of their land and their religion. With the rise of Mahayana Buddhism, Saman developed into Samantabhadra, one of the four principal bodhisattvas of Mahayana. Like his later manifestation, Samanta is usually depicted crowned and bejeweled, holding a lotus in his right hand and accompanied by a white elephant. At Weligama, an ancient port on Sri Lanka’s south coast, there is a 12-foot-high statue which some believe is the figure of Samantabhadra carved out of a huge moss-covered bolder. This statue is now called Kushtarajagala. It is thought that the Pilgrims from India and northern Sri Lanka disembarking at Weligama were greeted by this bodhisattva figure as they set out on the long trek to Sri Pada.
            
            
            The summit of the mountain is a small plateau, and according to measurements made by Lieut. Malcolm (the first European to ascend the mountain in 1816),” it is 74 ft. in length and 24 ft. in breadth” the total area being 1,776 sq. ft. On the top of the Peak broad steps lead up to a walled enclosure containing the rock over which is a tower-like structure.
