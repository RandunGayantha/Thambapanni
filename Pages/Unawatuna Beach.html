        <p class="hotel-des">Sri Lanka is known for its beautiful beaches, not just among its neighbouring countries, but in the whole of Asia. Not just beautiful, the Srilankan beaches offer awesome nightlife and many water activities to the people that come.
            One such awesome beach is the Unawatuna Beach which is one of the most beautiful places in Sri Lanka to visit. This beach is very popular but is a bit different from the other beaches of Sri Lanka. While every other beach is known for the happening life that it gives to its tourists, this beach is known for the kind of calmness that it provides to the visitors there.
            If you want to spend a good light afternoon, then you can simply come to this best beach in Sri Lanka to relax. The water and the sand here provide a very good environment overall, thus making it again a must-visit place.
            This place is the least crowded, but you will get everything that you require. One should not understand that since this is a quiet place, they cannot have fun here. If you want to have fun, then you can dive in the water or even go to the nearby restaurants and cafes and can chill.</p>
