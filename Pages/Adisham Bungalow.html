        <p class="hotel-des">The Adisham Bungalow was once the country house of Sir Thomas Lester Villiers, but today it houses the Adisham Monastery of the St. Benedict. Found just 3km away from Haputale town, the Adisham Bungalow is one of the most picturesque corners in the region.

The Legacy of a Colonial Planter
Constructed in 1931, the house was designed in the Tudor style and fashioned after the Leeds Castle in Kent- Sir Thomas Villiers even named it after the village he was born in and has all the trappings of what you would imagine an English mansion would have. The Bungalow has an impressive library which is filled from floor to ceiling with old dusty volumes that the planter held dear. Access to the whole house is limited and visitors are only allowed to see the library and living room, but there is an adjoining guest house where people are more than welcomed to stay.

Surrounded by Greenery
Sir Thomas Villiers spared no expense when it came to his home, but what’s even more splendid than the actual house is its surroundings. Adisham Bungalow is perched on the edge of a cliff which is flanked by a larger outcrop fringed with tall pine trees, which somehow dwarf the house. The country home also has a wonderful view of the Uva valley, as well as a beautiful garden and orchard that you can stroll through.</p>
