        <p class="hotel-des">Dondra Lighthouse was made in the era when Sri Lanka was a colony. This could be understood by the way of its construction. This building is very tall and you will get a very good view of the nearby surrounding areas when you stand on the top of it. This looks beautiful because of the rows of palm trees that are there across the building and also because it seems as if the top of this building is meeting the sky. One can come to visit this place along with his whole family. This is the place where families come and hang out together. You can click as many photographs as you want and can enjoy the scenic sunset that can be easily seen from the top of this lighthouse. The place is situated almost 165 km away from Colombo and therefore one can come here easily by any transportation from Colombo.</p>
